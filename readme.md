# Community-U, an introduction to being a good person

The purpose of this application is to create a platform where local communities can organize events to help others in their local communities. The current ability for people to organize events locally are limited through resources. Community-U empowers its users to have a media outlet for their local events, meet-ups, and fundraisers. This uplifts and allows those whom want to invest their time and resources to make a local impact.
